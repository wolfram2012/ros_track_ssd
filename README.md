# ROS MXnet SSD

### Disclaimer
This is a re-re-implementation of original SSD which is based on caffe. The official
repository is available [here](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd).
The arXiv paper is available [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325).  
The example that intended for reproducing the nice detector while fully utilize the remarkable traits of MXNet is available [here](https://github.com/zhreshold/mxnet-ssd).

And I just modified it into a ROS node for fun.
